The goal of wcc is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version of wcc from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmgirard/wcc")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(wcc)

# Extract the first ten minutes of interaction
first_ten <- dplyr::filter(head_pitch, time < 10 * 60 * 60)

# Set up parallel processing
future::plan(future::multisession)

# Conduct windowed cross-correlation analysis
res <- wcc(
  x = first_ten$x,
  y = first_ten$y,
  window_size = 4 * 60, # 4 sec windows
  window_increment = 60 / 10, # 1/10 sec increment
  lag_max = 2 * 60, # 2 sec maximum lag
  lag_increment = 60 / 10 # 1/10 sec increment
)

res$fisher_z
#> [1] 0.4329129
```
