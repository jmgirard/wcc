The goal of **bsync** is to provide a modern, high-efficiency R toolkit
for analyzing interpersonal and behavioral synchrony.

While traditional cross-correlation assumes that the association between
two time series is stationary over time, in many psychological and
behavioral contexts (such as interpersonal conversation or synchronized
movement), the lead-lag relationship between individuals is highly
dynamic. **bsync** allows researchers to quantify these nonstationary
associations using highly optimized windowed cross-correlation (WCC),
windowed dynamic time warping (WDTW), and optima-extraction algorithms.

Furthermore, the package provides a complete analytical pipeline for
behavioral time series. This includes robust preprocessing functions for
time-bin aggregation, zero-phase signal smoothing, and kinematic
velocity/speed calculations, as well as rigorous hypothesis testing via
circular-shift surrogate data generation (pseudo-synchrony testing).

## Installation

You can install the development version of bsync from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jmgirard/bsync) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jmgirard/bsync")
```

## Example Workflow

The following example demonstrates a Quick Start WCC pipeline. For a
deeper dive into WCC or to learn about Windowed Dynamic Time Warping
(WDTW), please see the included package vignettes.

We will use the included `sim_dyad` dataset, which contains 30 seconds
of simulated 3D motion tracking data for two individuals. In this
simulation, Person A begins by leading a rhythmic movement, they
synchronize in the middle, and Person B takes the lead by the end.

First, we load the package and prepare the data. We highly recommend
smoothing positional data before calculating velocities to prevent
high-frequency noise from amplifying and skewing the cross-correlations.
Here we apply a Savitzky-Golay filter and then calculate the 1D
directional velocity on the Z-axis.

``` r
library(bsync)
library(dplyr)

data("sim_dyad")

# Step 1: Smooth the raw position data and calculate 1D velocity
df <- sim_dyad |>
  mutate(
    z_A_smooth = smooth_signal(z_A, method = "sgolay", window = 5),
    z_B_smooth = smooth_signal(z_B, method = "sgolay", window = 5),
    vel_A = calc_velocity_1d(time, z_A_smooth, fill_edges = TRUE),
    vel_B = calc_velocity_1d(time, z_B_smooth, fill_edges = TRUE)
  )
```

Next, we calculate the windowed cross-correlations. Calling `summary()`
on the resulting object provides a clean, formatted overview of the
analysis settings and the distribution of correlation values.

``` r
# Step 2: Calculate Windowed Cross-Correlations
wcc_results <- wcc(
  x = df$vel_A,
  y = df$vel_B,
  window_size = 150,
  lag_max = 75,
  window_increment = 25,
  lag_increment = 1,
  na.rm = TRUE
)

# View the summary
summary(wcc_results)
#> 
#> ── Windowed Cross-Correlation Analysis ─────────────────────────────────────────
#> Total Windows: 87
#> Total Lags Tested: 151
#> Window Size: 150
#> Max Lag: 75
#> Overall Fisher's Z: 1.065
#> 
#> ── Cross-Correlation Value Distribution ──
#> 
#>      0%     25%     50%     75%    100% 
#> -0.9984 -0.6770  0.0410  0.7185  0.9986
#> ! 78 missing values (NA) detected.
```

Once the cross-correlations are calculated, we extract the specific lags
that represent the optimal association within each time window.
Summarizing the optima object displays the extraction metadata alongside
an overview of results.

``` r
# Step 3: Extract the Optima (Local Maxima)
optima <- pick_optima(
  obj = wcc_results,
  L_size = 5,
  strict_monotonic = FALSE,
  search_method = "local"
)

# View the optima results
summary(optima)
#> 
#> ── WCC Optima Summary ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> 
#> ── Completeness ──
#> 
#> • Total time windows: 87
#> • Valid optima retained: 87 (100%)
#> • Optima dropped (NA): 0 (0%)
#> 
#> ── Lag Directionality (Leadership) ──
#> 
#> • Positive Lags (x leads y): 41 (47.1%)
#> • Negative Lags (y leads x): 43 (49.4%)
#> • Zero Lags (Simultaneous): 3 (3.4%)
#> 
#> ── Optimum Value Distribution ──
#> 
#>     0%    25%    50%    75%   100% 
#> 0.9710 0.9947 0.9970 0.9976 0.9986
```

Finally, we visualize the resulting correlation landscape. The
underlying heatmap represents the cross-correlation values at each lag
and elapsed time window. The overlaid points and connecting lines
demonstrate the algorithm successfully tracking the shifting lag of
optimum association over the course of the interaction.

``` r
# Step 4: Plot the correlation landscape and overlay the shifting optima
plot_optima_overlay(
  surface_obj = wcc_results,
  optima_df = optima
)
```

### Surrogate Testing for Significance

Psychological and behavioral time series are highly autocorrelated,
which means random noise can sometimes look like genuine interaction. To
verify that our observed synchronization is statistically significant,
we can use the `wcc_surrogate()` function.

This function uses a circular shift method to misalign the two time
series, generating a null distribution of “pseudo-synchrony” that
preserves the natural autocorrelation of the data but breaks the dyadic
interaction.

``` r
# Step 5: Run surrogate analysis to calculate an empirical p-value
set.seed(2026)
surrogate_results <- wcc_surrogate(
  x = df$vel_A,
  y = df$vel_B,
  window_size = 150,
  lag_max = 75,
  window_increment = 25,
  lag_increment = 1,
  n_surrogates = 100
)

surrogate_results
#> ── WCC Surrogate Analysis (Pseudo-Synchrony) ───────────────────────────────────
#> Permutations: 100
#> Observed Fisher's Z: 1.065
#> Average Null Z: 0.9894
#> Empirical p-value: < 0.01
#> ✔ Observed synchrony is significantly greater than chance.
#> ℹ Note: 100 permutations may be too few for stable p-values.
#> Consider setting `n_surrogates >= 1000` for final reporting.
